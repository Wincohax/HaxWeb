   <p className='center1'>I'm Wincohax, an average teenager who is trying his best to not end up on a couch.</p>
  <p className='center1'>I started using computers when I was very young and I always liked the idea of customizing my system and learning how things work.</p>
  <p className='center1'><em>I spent Most of my childhood on my PC playing w/ VMS using VirtualBox Or VMWARE.</em></p>
  <p className='center1'>Nowadays I switched to <strong><em>Linux</em></strong> for a more pleasant exprience and <strong><em>I don't regret it.</em></strong> Now I'm trying to get into Web or Software development. 
  <p className='center1'>(One great example is this website)</p>

    <h1>What's Next?</h1>
    <p className='ayo3'>I'm in the process of finishing high school and also on the way to getting my english certification, my idea is to go to college or get a way of getting some kind of income.

I would like to create some projects that can be helpful for people, I also love the idea of Open Source so I'll mostly publish every software that I will make on Github.

I'm not that into commercial profit but I'm sure I'll get over it (?.</p>
