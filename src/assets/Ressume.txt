I'm Wincohax, an average teenager who is trying his best to not end up on a couch.

I started using computers when I was very young and I always liked the idea of customizing my system and learning how things work.

I spent Most of my childhood on my PC playing w/ VMS using VirtualBox Or VMWARE.

Nowadays I switched to Linux for a more pleasant exprience and I don't regret it. Now I'm trying to get into Web or Software development.
